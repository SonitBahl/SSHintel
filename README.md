&#x20; &#x20;

`SSHintel` is a lightweight SSH honeypot built using Python and Paramiko. It simulates a fake Linux shell to log unauthorized access attempts, capture credentials, and analyze attacker behavior in a controlled environment.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Logs SSH login attempts with IP, username, and password
- Emulates a minimal interactive Linux shell
- Supports basic commands (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`, `echo`, etc.)
- Optional `--tarpit` mode to slow down attackers with delayed output
- Fake filesystem with file creation and reading support

---

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. 🔑 Generate SSH Host Key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -m PEM -f static/server.key
```

> This will generate a private key at `static/server.key`. **Do not set a passphrase.**

---

### 2. 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Honeypot

Run the honeypot with a specific port, username, and password:

```bash
python run.py --port 2222 --username user1 --password pass123
```

> Default port is `2222` and host is `0.0.0.0`.

To enable tarpit mode:

```bash
python run.py --port 2222 --username user1 --password pass123 --tarpit
```

---

## 🔐 Testing from Another Terminal

Open a second terminal and try connecting:

```bash
ssh user1@localhost -p 2222
```

If the credentials match, you’ll be dropped into the emulated shell.

---

## 🚑 Optional: Clear Known Hosts (If Reconnecting)

To remove stale SSH fingerprints:

```bash
notepad "%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\known_hosts"
```

> Delete the relevant line containing `localhost` or the honeypot's IP.

---

## 📝 Logged Information

- Credentials are logged to `creds_logger`
- Shell commands are logged via `funnel_logger`

You can extend `logger.py` to send logs to files, remote servers, or alerting systems.

## 💪 Run with Docker (Alternative Method)

If you prefer to run the honeypot in a containerized environment, you can use the included Dockerfile.

### 🔨 Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t sshintel .
```

> This creates a Docker image named `sshintel`.

---

### 🚀 Run the Container

```bash
docker run -p 2222:2222 sshintel
```

This will:

- Automatically generate the SSH private key at `static/server.key` (if it doesn't already exist)
- Launch the honeypot on port `2222` with default credentials:\
  `username: user1`, `password: pass123`

---

### 🔮 Test the Honeypot

Open a second terminal and connect via SSH:

```bash
ssh user1@localhost -p 2222
```

You’ll be dropped into the simulated shell if the credentials match.

---

### 🧼 Stop and Clean Up

To stop the container:

```bash
docker ps  # Find the container ID
docker stop <container_id>
```

To remove the image:

```bash
docker rmi sshintel
```

> You can also export the image using `docker save -o sshintel.tar sshintel` and load it later with `docker load -i sshintel.tar`.
